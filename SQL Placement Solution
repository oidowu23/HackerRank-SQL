After looking at the question and tables provided, I solved this with these steps:
1. Created a CTE for All students with their salaries and correspnding best friend id (All_Salary)
2. Next, pulled all the friends id with their salaries (BestFriends)
3. Lastly, I compared All the Salaries to the Friends salaries using a Row_Number (Windown function) to join both tables


SOLUTION:
WITH All_Salary AS
(
SELECT p.id
        ,s.name 
        ,p.salary 
        ,f.friend_id -- to show what friend_id is to the friend
        , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY p.id) r1 -- this was needed to join this table to the next one in the right order
FROM Packages p
JOIN Students s
ON p.id= s.id
JOIN Friends f
ON s.id= f.id
   )
, BestFriends AS
(
SELECT a.friend_id
       , p.salary AS fsalary
       , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY a.id) r2
FROM All_Salary a
JOIN Packages p
ON a.friend_id=p.id
)
SELECT name
FROM (SELECT CASE WHEN b.fsalary > a.salary THEN a.name
        ELSE NULL END AS name
      , b.fsalary
FROM All_Salary a
JOIN BestFriends b
ON a.r1= b.r2) t
WHERE name IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY t.fsalary


To improve performance and optimize this code above, there is a shorter way:
SELECT name
FROM (SELECT s.id, s.name, p.salary,  f.friend_id, p1.salary AS bfsalary
      FROM Students s 
      JOIN Friends f ON s.id= f.id
      JOIN Packages p ON s.id=p.id
      JOIN Packages p1 ON f.friend_id= p1.id
      WHERE p1.salary >p.salary ) bf
ORDER BY bf.bfsalary
